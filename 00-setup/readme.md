# 00 Setup

This guide covers how to set up your environment to be able to run your VHDL code. There are two options discussed here:

1. Using the free Lite version of the [Altera QuartusÂ® Prime](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/download.html) suite (or just their [ModelSim](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/model-sim.html)): This makes it easier to upload your code to an Intel FPGA later on.
1. Using GHDL and GTKWave: This is also free but it's not attached to a specific FPGA vendor and it requires running commands through the terminal.
