# Intro to VHDL
Welcome to a minimalist guide to help beginners start on VHDL from scratch!

This guide does not cover how to upload a design to an FPGA, but it is a simple introduction to writing and simulating VHDL. It is recommended that you go from start to finish in order since some material builds on the previous.

**Contents**

0. [**Setup**](00-setup/readme.md): Download and setup an environment for modeling and simulating VHDL.
0. [**Basic Gates**](01-basic-gates.md): Learn about the basic skeleton of a VHDL code and different architectures.
0. **Flip-Flop**
0. **Multiplexers**
0. **Buses**
0. **Registers**: Expand the knowledge of Flip-Flops and learn how to create simple test benches.
0. **Adders**: Use different concepts previously discussed and learn how to create more advanced test benches.
